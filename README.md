# UN Population dataset


## About the Project

Visualizing population trends over the past 70 years in a compelling and insightful way that reveals new information to the audience. 
The goal is to craft a data-driven narrative using innovative visualization techniques to highlight key demographic changes with a focus on population. 

Using relevant variables from the United Nations dataset, created the following charts:

-**Introductory Chart(s):** Highlighting magnitude or part-to-whole relationships, providing a foundation for the main visualizations that follow.

-**Bump Chart:** Showing how rankings or relative positions have changed over time.

-**Slope Chart:** Illustrating trends by showing changes between two points in time, emphasizing differences or growth.

-**Connected Scatterplot:** Visualizing relationships and trends between two variables over time, revealing patterns that may not be apparent in simpler charts. 


## How to Use

To view the visualization, follow these steps:
1. Download the Tableau workbook from the repository.
2. Open Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
3. Open the downloaded workbook to interact with the visualization.
